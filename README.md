# Twitter Dashboard, Apache NiFi, Solr, Banana

Twitter dashboard using Apache NiFi, Solr and Banana

![Apache NiFi/Twitter Dashboard](https://github.com/UNGlobalPlatform/twitter-dash/blob/master/docs/twitter-dashboard.png?raw=true)

## Getting Started

Creating an interactive dashboard for your data

### Prerequisites

For this part we are going to need Solr, Banana and NiFi and we are going to create an interactive dashboard of the tweets.

## Installing

## Solr

Download Solr and install it.

After downloading solr, all you need to do is untar the tar file and move it to /usr/local/solr.

```
tar xzf solr-5.2.1.tgz solr-5.2.1/bin/install_solr_service.sh â€“strip-components=2 ./install_solr_service.sh solr-5.2.1.tgz -i /usr/local/solr -u $user
```

where -i is installation directory and $user is the user you are using now.
After you perform above steps you will get the installed directory at /usr/local/solr/ and now you can start the services

```
mv /usr/local/solr/solr-5.2.1/* /usr/local/solr/
./bin/solr start -c -z localhost:9983
```
