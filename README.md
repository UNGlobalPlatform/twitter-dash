# Twitter Dashboard, Apache NiFi, Solr, Banana

Twitter dashboard using Apache NiFi, Solr and Banana

![Apache NiFi/Twitter Dashboard](https://github.com/UNGlobalPlatform/twitter-dash/blob/master/docs/twitter-dashboard.png?raw=true)

## Getting Started

Creating an interactive dashboard for your data

### Prerequisites

For this part we are going to need Solr, Banana and NiFi and we are going to create an interactive dashboard of the tweets.

## Installing

## Solr

Download Solr and install it.

After downloading solr, all you need to do is untar the tar file and move it to /usr/local/solr.

```
tar xzf solr-5.2.1.tgz solr-5.2.1/bin/install_solr_service.sh â€“strip-components=2
./install_solr_service.sh solr-5.2.1.tgz -i /usr/local/solr -u $user
```

where -i is installation directory and $user is the user you are using now.
After you perform above steps you will get the installed directory at /usr/local/solr/ and now you can start the services

```
mv /usr/local/solr/solr-5.2.1/* /usr/local/solr/
./bin/solr start -c -z localhost:9983
```
Once you start the solr you can open the web url at http://hostname:8983/solr

## Banana

Banana is a tool to create dashboards to visualize data you have stored in Solr. Commonly used with Logstash for log data. Its a fork of kibana.
Download Banana and install it.
Run Solr at least once to create the webapp directory:
```
cd $SOLR_HOME/bin/
./solr start
```
Copy banana folder to $SOLR_HOME/server/solr-webapp/webapp/

Browse to http://hostname:8983/solr/banana/src/index.html

## Apache NiFi

Now create a data flow in NiFi to send the twitter data to Solr.
![Apache NiFi/Twitter Dashboard](https://github.com/UNGlobalPlatform/twitter-dash/blob/master/docs/nififlow.png?raw=true)

Configure the PutSolrContentStream processor as follows, this will push the tweets to Solr.

![Apache NiFi/Twitter Dashboard](https://github.com/UNGlobalPlatform/twitter-dash/blob/master/docs/solrconfig1.jpeg?raw=true)

Enable the flow and then check Solr.
Use the following URL and search the Solr index.

http://hostname:8983/solr

## Dashboard
Use the following URL to access the dashboard.
http://hostname:8983/solr/banana/src/index.html#/dashboard
You will have a timeline of tweets in the dashboard. The dashboard is highly configurable, have a play.
